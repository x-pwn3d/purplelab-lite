## 📖 Project Overview

**PurpleLab-lite** is a **lightweight, automated Purple Team lab** designed for cybersecurity training and testing.  
It allows security practitioners and students to **simulate real-world attack scenarios** against a vulnerable web application while automatically collecting and analyzing logs for indicators of compromise (IoCs).

Key objectives:  

- Deploy a vulnerable target: **[OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/)**  
- Automatically launch a variety of attacks:
  - SQL Injection (SQLi)  
  - Webshell uploads  
  - Malicious User Agents  
- Collect and analyze logs (`access.log`, `error.log`)  
- Detect IoCs using **YARA rules** and **regex patterns** (YARA is included in the Docker container)  
- Generate comprehensive automatic reports (`reports/report.md`)  

This lab is ideal for **Purple Team exercises, SIEM testing, and security education**, all on a single machine.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **Docker** & **docker-compose** installed  
- **Python 3.9+** (for local scripts if needed)  

> No need to install YARA locally, it is already included in the Docker container.

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
# Build and start the full lab environment (attacker + target + logs)
docker compose up --build
````

This will:

1. Launch the vulnerable Juice Shop application in a container
2. Start the attacker and harness containers to execute attack scenarios
3. Collect logs and automatically detect suspicious activity
4. Generate a Markdown report at `reports/report.md`

## 🧩 Detection & Reporting

* **YARA rules**:

  * `logs_and_webshells.yar`: Detects webshells and suspicious log patterns
  * `sqli.yar`: Detects SQLi attempts (tautologies, UNION, time-based, comment-style)
* **Regex/Grep patterns**: Detect malicious User Agents or custom keywords
* **Automatic Markdown report**: Lists all matches with files and rules triggered

---

## ⚡ Contribution

Contributions are welcome!

* Add new attack scenarios
* Extend YARA rules for additional IoCs
* Improve report formatting

Please submit a **pull request** or **issue** on GitHub.
